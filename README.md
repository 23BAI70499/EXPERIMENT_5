# Unit-5: Optimize Frontend Performance Using Lazy Loading

This project demonstrates how to optimize frontend performance in a React Single Page Application (SPA) using **lazy loading** with **React.lazy()** and **Suspense**, including **route-based lazy loading** using **React Router DOM**.

---

## 🚀 Experiments Covered

### ✅ Experiment 1: Component Lazy Loading using React.lazy and Suspense
- Lazy loads individual components only when required.
- Uses `Suspense` to show a fallback UI while loading.

### ✅ Experiment 2: Route-Based Lazy Loading in SPA
- Lazy loads pages only when user navigates to that route.
- Improves startup speed and reduces initial bundle size.

---

## 🎯 Aim

- To optimize frontend performance by implementing lazy loading of components in a SPA using React.lazy and Suspense.
- To implement route-based lazy loading to improve performance in a Single Page Application.
